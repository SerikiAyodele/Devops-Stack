BASICS
* The first statement in a go file must be "package" and all our code must belong to a package
* Go needs to know where the entrypoint is? where to start the program?
* A program can only have one main function, because we can only have one entrypoint
* A package is a collection of source files
* To iterate through a slice, we need a range expresssion. Range iteratesover elements
  for different data structures (so not only array and slices)
* For arrays and slices, range provides the index and value for each element
* Functions are used to reduce code duplication and will only execute when called.
* A package is a collcetion of go files
* We cannot mix data types in a map
