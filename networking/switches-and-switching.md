# SWICTCHES AND SWITCHING
A swicth is a device used to forward traffic from one device to another within a local network.

# Methods Of Frame Forwarding
- cut through-swiching: the switch forwards data almost immediately
- Store and Forward: here the swicth will store thethe frame data in it's memory buffer till it's complete
  and perform error checking on it before sending it.

# ROUTERS AND ROUTING
- A router is a network device that allows for communication between networks
- All routing devices hold a routing table that contains information about the networks,
interfaces, and metrics.

# OSI mODEL
LAYER 7
- Any application that supports network communication will be developed using network
application programming interfaces (APIs). The API contains code that tells the
application how to talk to the application layer
