##what is docker
* Docker makes it easy to take whatever we've built locally and run it onto a server that has the docker runtime environment, so if it runs on your machine, it will also run anywhere that has the docker runtime environment.
* Docker is a tool for running applications in an isolated environmnet, similar to a virtual machine, but
is faster, does not require alot of memory and an entire operating system to operate.

##images and containers
* An image is a template for creating an environment of your choice. It is also a snapshot. An image contains everything your app needs to run. Once we have images, containers come to play.
* A container is simply a running instance of an image. W run a container from an image.
