## Command Line Utilities For Manipulating Text Files
#### `cat`
- Short for concatenate and is used for reading and printing files as well 
  as simply vieing files i.e `cat <filename>`
- The main purpose of cat is often to combine multple files together

#### `echo`
- Echo can be used to display a string on standard output, or to place in a new 
  file(using the > operator) or append to an already existing file (using the >> operator)
- Echo is particularly useful for viewing the values of environment variables

#### `sed` and `awk`
- sed is an abbreviation for stream editor
- It is a powerful text processing tool, used to modify the contents of a file or  
  input stream, usually placing the contents in a new file or output stream

- awk is used to extract and then print specific contents of a file
- syntax is `awk <command> file`

#### File Manipulation Utilities
- Common manipulation programs are:
    - **sort**: used to rearrange the lines of a text file, in ascending or descending
            order, according to a sort key. The default key is alphabetically.
    - **uniq**: removes duplicates consecutive lines in a textfile and is useful for 
            simplifying the text display. Because uniq requires that the duplicate 
            entries must be consecutive, one  often runs sort first and then pipes 
            the output into uniq; if sort is used with the -u option, it can do all this in one step
    - **paste**: Can be used to combine different fields from different files.
    - **join**: Is an enhanced version of paste, it checks wether the files share a 
            common field and then joins the lines in the two files based on a common 
            field(contains same value).
    - **split**: split is used to break up (or split) a file into equal-sized segments for easier
             viewing and manipulation, and is generally used only on relatively large files
