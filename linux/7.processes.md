What's a PROCESS?
It is an instance of one or more tasks executing on our computers. It is differnrt from a program 
or a command. A single command might start several processes simultaneously
Processes use the computer's resources, such as it's CPU

|Daemons              |Many processes that are launched during startup, they run     |httpd        |

|Kernel Threads       |These are kernel tasks that users can neither start not       |kthreadd     |
|                     |terminate and have little control over                        |             |                                                                     

Users and Group ID
* The user who starts a process is identified by the real user id (RUID)
* The user who determines the access rights for the users is identified by the Effective UID (EUID).
* The EUID may or may not be the same as the RUID.

* The priority for a process can be set by specifyng a nicce value, the higher the nice value the 
  lower the priority and vice versa
