## FileSystem Operations
### Linux Partitions
* Partitions refer to the division of physical storage  devicek, such as SSD or hard drive, into
  seperate isolated sections.
* Each filesystem on a linux system occupies a disk partition
* Partitions help to organize the content of disks according to the kind and the use of the data contained

### Mount Points
* Before we can start to use a file-system we need to mount it on the file system tree at a mount point.
* Mount points are ussually empty directories, because, if we mount a file-system on a non-empty
  directory, the former content of the file-system will be covered up and unaccessible until the
  file-sysetem is unmounted.

### Mounting and Unmounting
* The `mount` command is sued to attach a filesystem somewhere within the filesystem tree
* To `attach a file-system somewhere within the filesystem tree` means to mount a file-system,
  such as a partition, network share, or other storage device, at a specific directory location,
  within the existing directory structure of your operating system's filesystem.

### Network File System(NFS)
* NFS is a protocol and a distributed file system that allows remote users and applications
  to access and share files and directories over a network.
* The file to be edited to modify the behaviour of the nfs is `/etc/fstab` where fstab is 
  file system table.
  #### NFS on the server
  * NFS uses daemons(built in networking and service processes in linux) and is started by
    typing: 
    `sudo systemclt start nfs` to start
    `sudo systemclt restart nfs` to restart
    `sudo systemctl enable nfs` to make sure the nfs service starts whenever the system is booted up

## Filesystem Layout
### The /bin and /sbin directories
* /bin directory contains executable binaries, essential commands used to boot the system
