## File Systems
### Linux Partitions
* Partitions refer to the division of physical storage  devicek, such as SSD or hard drive, into
  seperate isolated sections.
* Each filesystem on a linux system occupies a disk partition
* Partitions help to organize the content of disks according to the kind and the use of the data contained

### Mount Points
* Before we can start to use a file-system we need to mount it on the file system tree at a mount point.
* Mount points are ussually empty directories, because, if we mount a file-system on a non-empty
  directory, the former content of the file-system will be covered up and unaccessible until the
  file-sysetem is unmounted.

### Mounting and Unmounting
* The `mount` command is sued to attach a filesystem somewhere within the filesystem tree
* To `attach a file-system somewhere within the filesystem tree` means to mount a file-system,
  such as a partition, network share, or other storage device, at a specific directory location,
  within the existing directory structure of your operating system's filesystem.
