Lab 15.2: Working with Files and Directories in a Script

Write a script which:

Prompts the user for a directory name and then creates it with mkdir.
Changes to the new directory and prints out where it is using pwd.
Using touch, creates several empty files and runs ls on them to verify they are empty.
Puts some content in them using echo and redirection.
Displays their content using cat.
Says goodbye to the user and cleans up after itself.
