## INTRO
with scripting, we can tell the system a series of action that it needs to take, so that we can reuse these in the future to automate alot of tasks.

#### Features
- Shares procedures among several users
- Automate tasks and reduce risk of errors
- Provide a controlled interface to users
- Create new commands using using combination of utilities
- Quick prototyping, no need to compile
- Combine long and repititive sequences of command intoone simple command

#### Syntaxes
- The \ operator: Adding this to the end of each line causes the shell to combine 
  multiple lines and execute them as one single command.
- We can put multiple commands on a single line by using either `;` or `&&` or `||`
- Functions: code of block that implements a set of operations. They are useful for 
  executing procedures multiple times, perharps with varying input variables.

#### The Case Statement
Is used in scenarios where the actual value of a variable can lead to different
execution paths.

#### Discarding Output With /dev/null
Certain commands (such as find) are quite capable of spewing voluminous and overwhelming 
amounts of output. To avoid this, we can redirect the large output to a special file 
(a device node) called /dev/null. This pseudofile is also called the bit bucket or black hole.

All data written to /dev/null is discarded.

`$ ls -lR /tmp >& /dev/null`
In the above command, both stdout and stderr will be dumped into /dev/null.
