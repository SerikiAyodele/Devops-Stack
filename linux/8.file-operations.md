## FileSystem Operations
### Linux Partitions
* Partitions refer to the division of physical storage  devicek, such as SSD or hard drive, into
  seperate isolated sections.
* Each filesystem on a linux system occupies a disk partition
* Partitions help to organize the content of disks according to the kind and the use of the data contained

### Mount Points
* Before we can start to use a file-system we need to mount it on the file system tree at a mount point.
* Mount points are ussually empty directories, because, if we mount a file-system on a non-empty
  directory, the former content of the file-system will be covered up and unaccessible until the
  file-sysetem is unmounted.

### Mounting and Unmounting
* The `mount` command is sued to attach a filesystem somewhere within the filesystem tree
* To `attach a file-system somewhere within the filesystem tree` means to mount a file-system,
  such as a partition, network share, or other storage device, at a specific directory location,
  within the existing directory structure of your operating system's filesystem.

### Network File System(NFS)
* NFS is a protocol and a distributed file system that allows remote users and applications
  to access and share files and directories over a network.
* The file to be edited to modify the behaviour of the nfs is `/etc/fstab` where fstab is 
  file system table.
  #### NFS on the server
  * NFS uses daemons(built in networking and service processes in linux) and is started by
    typing: 
    `sudo systemclt start nfs` to start
    `sudo systemclt restart nfs` to restart
    `sudo systemctl enable nfs` to make sure the nfs service starts whenever the system is booted up

## Filesystem Layout
### The /bin and /sbin directories
* /bin directory contains executable binaries, essential commands used to boot the system

### The /proc filesystem
* filesystems mounted on proc are called pseudo-filesystems because they have no actual permanent 
  presence anywhere on the disk.
* It contains only virtual files(files that exist only in memory)
* It's useful because, the information it reports is gathered only as needed but never needs
  storage on the disk.

### The /var directory
* Contains files that are expected to change in size and content as the system is running(var stands for variable)

### The /etc directory
* The home for system configuration files
* Only the superuser can modify the files here

## Comparing files and file types
### Comparing files with diff
* To compare two files, at the command prompt we type
  ` diff [options] <filename1> <filename2>`
* We can compare three files at once using **diff3**, the syntax is 
  `diff3 <first-file> <common-file> <second-file>`
* Chnages to source code are distributed through patches. A patch file contains changes required to update an
  older version of a file to a new one 

## Backing up and compressing data
* We can backup data or our entire system by using `cp` or `rsync`
* `rsync` is more efficient beacsue it checks if the file being copied already exists and it copies only 
  the parts of the file that has actually changed
